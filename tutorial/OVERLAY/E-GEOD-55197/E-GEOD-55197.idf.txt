Investigation Title	The P. aeruginosa PA14 transcriptome recorded under 14 different experimental conditions																
Comment[Submitted Name]	The P. aeruginosa PA14 transcriptome recorded under 14 different experimental conditions
Experiment Description	We analyzed the transcriptional profile of P.aeruginosa PA14 grown under 14 different environmental conditions. These included conditions of growth within biofilms, at various temperatures, osmolarities and phosphate concentrations, under anaerobic conditions, attached to a surface and conditions encountered within the eukaryotic host. We found that >30% of the PA14 genome was differentially regulated at least under one of the 14 environmental conditions (referred to as the adaptive transcriptome). Most of the genes were also differentially regulated upon sigma factor hyper expression and/or inactivation (GEO accession number GSE54999) and many of those belonged to primary alternative sigma factor regulons. The samples of P. aeruginosa PA14 wild type strain were cultivated under 14 different experimental conditions and were analyzed by RNA-seq. For each condition, at least two biological replicates were generated Please note that PA14 is our standard lab strain used for all generated data in this records. There is no mutation introduced for any of those experiments, and thus, the descriptions only highlight the growth conditions.

Protocol Description	RNA-seq reads were mapped to the PA14 genome using the Stampy aligner with default settings. The Reads-per-Gene were calculated from the SAM files counting only the reads that were located within the gene boundaries Genome_build: gi|116048575|ref|NC_008463.1| Supplementary_files_format_and_content: The processed files in TXT format include Genes and Reads-per-gene	Cells from 3 pooled cultures were harvested by addition of the same volume of RNA-protect buffer (Qiagen) and centrifugation.	Using Rneasy kit (Qiagen) plus Qiashredder columns. Customized protocol (Dötsch et al., PloS ONE, 2012). Briefly, eukariotic RNA was depleted using MICROBEnrich Kit (both for tumor samples and control sampels), subsequently bacterial rRNA was depleted using MICROBExpress kit with the Pseudomonas module (Ambion) and fragmented by sonication using Covaris Adaptive Acoustics device (Covaris). Upon ligation of barcoded adapters, reverse transcription with SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen) followed. Amplification was done by PCR using Illumina platform compatible primers. Established cDNA library was normalized by double strand specific nuclease treatment (Evrogen) according DSN Normalization Sample Preparation Guide from Illumina.	Iron starvation was induced by growing cultures in 50 % LB medium (diluted with H2O) to an OD600 of 1.5 and incubation with the iron-chelating agents 2,2’-bipyridl for 70 minutes prior to harvesting	Biofilm cultures were incubated in 96-well plates as described previously (Dötsch et al., PloS ONE, 2012) and harvested after 24 h	Biofilm cultures were incubated in 96-well plates as described previously (Dötsch et al., PloS ONE, 2012) and harvested after 48 h	The overnight culture of P. aeruginosa PA14 was diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in 10 ml M9 medium and incubated for 1 hour at RT with agitation	Anoxic PA14 cultures were harvested after 16h incubation in an Whitley anaerobic workstation at 37°C in PYG-KNO3 [DSMZ_Medium 104, supplemented with 100 mM KNO3]	Cultures growing in LB medium at 37 °C were harvested after 12 h of incubation	Cultures were cultivated in LB medium with low osmolarity containing 8 mM NaCl and were harvested after reaching an OD600 of 1.0	The overnight culture of P. aeruginosa PA14 was diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 in 10 ml M9 medium and inoculated for 1 h in a cell harvesting system	Ex-vivo samples were obtained by using a mouse model in which intravenously administered planktonic P. aeruginosa PA14 bacteria are enriched in transplantable subcutaneous mouse tumors (model was described in Komor et al., 2012)	Cultures growing in LB medium at 37 °C were harvested after reaching an OD600 of 1.0	Cultures were grown in LB to an OD600 of 2.2, exposed to temperatures of 50 °C	Cultures were grown in DeMoss Medium under low phosphate conditions and harvested after reaching an OD600 of 2.0	Cultures were grown in LB to an OD600 of 2.2, exposed to temperatures of 42 °C	Cultures growing in LB medium at 37 °C were harvested after reaching an OD600 of 2.0
